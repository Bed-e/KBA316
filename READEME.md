MY SBA IDEA:
DRAWING TOOL THat uses this as a base^
changes:
-no random colors✅
-add colormenu✅
-can modify r, g, b, and a value. (box input or slider?)✅
-print button to print/save page using window.print();❌
-toggle button to clear options menu before screenshot✅

Extras:
-changeable brush size✅
-changeable brush shape (square?)❌
-preview of color on colormenu✅
-colormenu could be a quarter circle in a corner with cute round font, and the background of it could be the pen color ✅
-SQUASH INFINITE DRAWING (w/o clicking) BUG ✅
-create list of brush strokes and impliment undoing❌
-display black circle around edge of circle before it's placed ie cursor highlight❌
